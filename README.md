  ***Description:*** BESO can add elements in the area of material "high efficiency" (such as high material stress). This ability to add elements makes the shape optimization ability of the progressive optimization method stronger, easier to reduce the maximum stress and stress concentration, makes the structural stress distribution uniform, and finds a better force transmission path. It can also delete inefficient units in the model. We use the stiffness optimization mathematical model to illustrate the basic principle of BESO.I use the CFD to calculate the Load parameters and use BESO algorithms to calculate the structure.
